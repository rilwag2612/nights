> "I'm not worried about the ad revenue from Gamejolt."

It’s unknown whether this statement applies strictly to GameJolt or to other forms of ad revenue,  
but many in the community infer that non-intrusive monetization (like ads or donations) isn’t a major concern.  
*(This interpretation may be outdated or incorrect — please do your own research before monetizing any fangame.)*
